# Stock-price-prediction-model:
This repository contains a stock price prediction model implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited for time series data, making them an ideal choice for predicting stock prices based on historical trends.

Features:
LSTM Architecture: Leverages the power of LSTM for accurate predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
Visualization: Plots to visualize stock price trends and model predictions.
Performance Metrics: Evaluation of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
